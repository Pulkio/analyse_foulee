# Gait Analysis with XsensDot IMU

# Description:

This project is part of a master's degree program, where the main objective was to analyze the human gait using an IMU, specifically the XsensDot placed on the foot. The primary measurements derived from the sensor include stride speed, distance, and stride length.
Scope and Limitations:

While the project has been successful in collecting and processing data on the aforementioned metrics, please note that the number of trials the script has been tested on is still quite low. This limitation means that the current version of the script may not provide a comprehensive or highly accurate understanding of the quality of the gait analysis it offers.
